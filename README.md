This is an "Open in MATLAB Online" demo based on Arnaldo Rodriguez-Gonzalez's work. I discovered it on BlueSky via this thread https://bsky.app/profile/aghostinthefigures.bsky.social/post/3lbxhdvoff22x

The original source for these files is at https://aghostinthefigures.com/teaching-resources/ 

The point of this demo is to show that users can open up Live Scripts in MATLAB Online via the 'Open in MATLAB Online' button and that this works even when they don't have a MATLAB License as desribed in this blog post 

All you need to do is upload the .mlx files to a github repo and construct the links using this form https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online/git.html

* An interactive activity on the connection between approximation convergence and the existence or non-existence to solutions of boundary-value problems.

* A simulator to visualize the motion of a disk-in-a-pipe under the influence of gravity, intended to teach students about “rolling without slip” and its effects on motion.
